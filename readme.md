# JHttpServer

## Description
This is http/1.1 server I decided to write from scratch to get a better 
understanding of what happens underneath the framework we all use every day.
This is a pretty naive implementation and would require much more work to be 
suitable to production use.

## Aim
The aim is to have those functionalities fully working:
- Endpoint binding
- Route grouping
- Error handling
- Handling multiple request at the same time
